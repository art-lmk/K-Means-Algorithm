# K-Means-Algorithm
This is a type of unsupervised machine learning that identifies similar instances and classifies them into clusters
Can be used in 
1. Cluster segmentation- here,customers are clustered based on their purchases and their activities on the website
2. Data Analysis- When you analyze new dataset, it can be helpful to run a cluster algorithm then analyze each set separately
3. Dimensionality reduction- Once a cluster has been formed, you can measure each instance's affinity with each cluster. Affinity is the measurement of how well an instance fits into a cluster
4. Feature Engineering- Cluster affinities can be used as extra features
5. Anomaly detection(outlier detection)- An anomaly is any instance that is likely to have low affintity
6. Search engines- Some search engines let yousearch for an image that are silimar to the refernce image.
